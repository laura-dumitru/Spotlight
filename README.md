# Spotlight

## An interactive horizontal slider quiz built with JavaScript and GSAP animation.

Spotlight is a replica of an interactive mobile ad which uses tap and hold functionality to draw focus to a specific area on the screen. It uses a mask over an image to create the spotlight effect and GSAP animation to engage the user to interact with the ad. The spotlight can be turned on or off using the toggle.

## The problem it solves

The project is a replica of a template built while working for a mobile advertising company.

It was created to address limitations in the existing ad software, thus expanding the companyâ€™s product offerings in the competitive mobile advertising landscape. This innovative project features interactive elements such as tap and hold functionality, designed to enhance user engagement and drive ad performance. The template was used to build adverts for clients such as Hugo Boss, Chanel, Jaguar and more.
